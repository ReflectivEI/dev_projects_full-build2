# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Trigger

Last triggered: 2026-01-24T09:44:05.061Z

This file exists solely to trigger Cloudflare Pages webhook deployments.
Cloudflare watches the repo and deploys when it sees changes.

## Why this is needed:

- GitHub Actions builds successfully
- But Cloudflare webhook doesn't always trigger
- Modifying this file forces Cloudflare to detect changes
- Cloudflare then pulls latest code and deploys

## Current deployment:

- Commit: b49d997
- Contains: getCueColorClass function
- Should fix: Blank screen on roleplay page
