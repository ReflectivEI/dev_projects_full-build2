# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Trigger

Last triggered: 2026-01-24T09:58:27.003Z

## Emergency Fix Applied:

✅ Disabled GitHub Pages workflow (was conflicting)
✅ Added cache purging to Cloudflare workflow
✅ Added getCueColorClass verification
✅ Forcing fresh deployment now

## What should happen:

1. Cloudflare workflow runs
2. Builds with getCueColorClass function
3. Verifies function is in bundle
4. Deploys to Cloudflare Pages
5. Purges ALL Cloudflare cache
6. New bundle goes live within 60 seconds

## Verification:

After 60 seconds:
- Go to: https://reflectivai-app-prod.pages.dev/roleplay
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R
- Check DevTools Console for errors
- Page should load correctly!
