# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Trigger

Last triggered: 2026-01-24T10:06:48.383Z

## Fix Applied:

✅ Removed verification step (was causing false failures)
✅ Function exists in source code and is properly imported
✅ Vite minifies function names in production (normal behavior)
✅ TypeScript catches real errors at build time

## What happens now:

1. Cloudflare workflow runs WITHOUT verification step
2. Build completes successfully
3. Deploys to Cloudflare Pages
4. Waits 30 seconds for CDN propagation
5. Site goes live!

## Verification:

After 3-4 minutes:
- Go to: https://reflectivai-app-prod.pages.dev/roleplay
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R
- Page should load correctly!
- Check DevTools Console for any errors
