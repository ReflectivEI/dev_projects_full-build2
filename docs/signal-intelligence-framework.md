# ReflectivAI Core Intelligence Framework

## Purpose
This document establishes canonical definitions and implementation guidelines for Signal Intelligence, Emotional Intelligence (EI), and behavioral model integrations within ReflectivAI.

---

## PART 1 — SIGNAL INTELLIGENCE (Core DNA)

### Canonical Definition
Signal Intelligence is a working construct used within ReflectivAI to describe the ability to:

**Notice, interpret, and respond appropriately to observable signals—verbal, conversational, engagement-based, and contextual—during professional interactions.**

- "Intelligence" refers to discernment, not cleverness
- The emphasis is on separating signal from noise in real time
- Signal Intelligence is not a validated behavioral science framework and must never be positioned as such

### Valid Signal Inputs (Strictly Enforced)
Signal Intelligence may operate only on observable interaction signals:

- **Verbal signals**: tone shifts, pacing, certainty vs hesitation
- **Conversational signals**: deflection, repetition, topic avoidance
- **Engagement signals**: silence, responsiveness changes, abrupt closure
- **Contextual signals**: urgency cues, alignment language, stakeholder presence

### Prohibited Actions
You MUST NOT:
- Infer emotional state
- Infer personality or intent
- Diagnose motivation
- Assign permanent traits

All outputs must be framed as interpretive hypotheses, not truths.

## PART 2 — DISC: OPTIONAL BEHAVIORAL LENS

### Positioning Rules (Mandatory)
DISC is a trademarked behavioral communication model.

Within ReflectivAI:
- DISC is never treated as Emotional Intelligence
- DISC is never inferred automatically by AI
- DISC may be used only if explicitly enabled and selected by the user

**Approved framing**: "Optional Behavioral Communication Lens (DISC)"

**Prohibited framing**: "DISC-based intelligence", "DISC EQ", "DISC-driven psychology"

### DISC Functional Boundaries
DISC may:
- Influence language style suggestions
- Inform communication framing options
- Act as a user-selected lens

DISC may NOT:
- Override Signal Intelligence
- Determine Influence Drivers
- Drive scoring, prediction, or profiling
- Appear as a default dropdown

---

## PART 3 — THREE-LAYER INTELLIGENCE MODEL

ReflectivAI preserves three distinct, visible layers:

### Layer 1 — Signal Intelligence (Core, Always On)
- Observes interaction signals
- Feeds coaching insights
- Supports real-time adaptation

### Layer 2 — Influence Drivers (Decision Logic, Non-Personality)
Examples:
- Evidence-Weighted
- Experience-Informed
- Guideline-Anchored
- Risk Orientation
- Patient-Outcome Priority

These are decision signals, not personality traits.

### Layer 3 — Behavioral Models (Optional Integrations)
- DISC (if enabled)
- Client-approved alternatives

**These layers must never collapse into a single persona or label.**

---

## PART 4 — EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE (EI)

### Definition (ReflectivAI-Specific, Defensible)
Emotional Intelligence refers to the user's **demonstrated ability** to:
1. Accurately perceive signals from others
2. Interpret those signals appropriately in context
3. Regulate their response
4. Adapt communication in a way that preserves trust, clarity, and credibility

**EI is treated as a demonstrated capability, not a personality trait.**

### Approved EI Metrics (Ability-Based, Observable)

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Empathy Accuracy | How accurately the user recognized and responded to relevant signals |
| Clarity & Alignment | How well the user's response aligned to expressed needs/constraints |
| Adaptive Communication | How effectively the user adjusted approach based on observed signals |
| Discovery Depth | How well the user validated assumptions and surfaced meaningful information |

### Avoid
- "Emotional awareness score"
- "Personality fit"
- "Emotional type"

---

## PART 5 — EI SCORING

### Positioning
EI scoring in ReflectivAI is a **Reflective Index**, not a psychological assessment.

It represents: "How consistently a user demonstrates emotionally intelligent behaviors in observable interactions."

### Calculation Principles
EI scores must:
- Be derived from observable behaviors and responses
- Reflect pattern consistency, not one-off moments
- Be explainable in plain language

### User-Facing Explanation (Required)
Every EI score must include:
- What signals were observed
- What response choices were made
- Where alignment was strong
- Where adaptation could improve

**No opaque scoring. No hidden weighting.**

---

## PART 6 — COMPLIANCE GUARDRAILS

You MUST ensure:
- No psychological profiling
- No personality inference
- No permanent labeling
- No automated persuasion
- Full explainability of guidance and scores

**Signal Intelligence = observational**
**EI Metrics = demonstrated capability**
**DISC = optional behavioral lens**

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

This implementation is successful if:
- Signal Intelligence feels like the nervous system
- EI metrics feel fair, understandable, and coachable
- DISC feels optional and clearly bounded
- Users understand why feedback exists
- Legal teams can defend every claim

**If EI feels diagnostic, DISC feels central, or HCPs feel "typed," the implementation has failed.**
