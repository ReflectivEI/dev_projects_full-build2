clear, defensible hierarchy you can use verbatim for a slide, product page, or legal-reviewed client explainer. This resolves confusion and locks your differentiation.

ReflectivAI Selling & Coaching Frameworks

How Emotional Intelligence, Communication Models, and Coaching Tools Work Together

⸻

Layer 1 — Emotional Intelligence (Core Measurement Layer)

What ReflectivAI measures and optimizes

Emotional Intelligence is the foundation of ReflectivAI.
It assesses how effectively a seller perceives, interprets, and responds to human decision-making in complex sales conversations.

Measured capabilities (examples):
	•	Empathy accuracy (did the rep correctly understand what matters?)
	•	Adaptation quality (did they adjust based on cues?)
	•	Clarity of intent and message alignment
	•	Objection response appropriateness
	•	Emotional regulation under pressure

Key point:
This layer evaluates internal capability + external execution.
It is not personality-based and not behavioral labeling.

Layer 2 — Behavioral Communication Models (Supporting Insight Layer)

How sellers adapt their approach

Behavioral models help sellers apply EI more effectively by understanding observable communication preferences.

DISC (Behavioral Communication Model)

DISC supports emotionally intelligent interactions but does not measure emotional intelligence.
	•	Focus: observable behavior patterns
	•	Purpose: adapt communication style to stakeholder preferences
	•	Use case: message framing, pacing, tone, structure

DISC Communication Styles
	•	Dominance (D): Direct, results-oriented, decisive
	•	Influence (I): Enthusiastic, collaborative, optimistic
	•	Steadiness (S): Patient, reliable, team-oriented
	•	Conscientiousness (C): Analytical, precise, systematic

Important distinction (explicit):
DISC explains how someone tends to communicate.
EI explains how well someone perceives, regulates, and adapts emotionally.

DISC informs EI-driven adaptation.
DISC does not replace EI assessment.

Layer 3 — Coaching & Execution Tools (Action Layer)

How improvement happens

This layer turns insight into behavior change.

Tools include:
	•	Adaptive language examples (not scripts)
	•	Coaching prompts tied to EI gaps
	•	AI-guided practice and role-play
	•	Manager coaching recommendations
	•	Progress tracking over time

Compliance-safe framing (pharma):
	•	Guidance, not mandated language
	•	Context-aware, not prescriptive
	•	Reinforces approved messaging without scripting

⸻

How the Layers Work Together (Simple Flow)
	1.	EI metrics identify what needs improvement
	2.	Behavioral models inform how to adapt communication
	3.	Coaching tools drive deliberate practice and change

This prevents:
	•	Personality stereotyping
	•	Generic “AI coaching” claims
	•	One-size-fits-all scripts

⸻

Why This Matters (Buyer-facing truth)

Most platforms:
	•	Optimize content, activity, or workflows

ReflectivAI:
	•	Optimizes human effectiveness in high-stakes conversations

⸻

Risks
	•	If DISC is presented without hierarchy, buyers may assume EI = personality.
	•	If EI scoring is not explainable, trust erodes.

Assumptions
	•	EI metrics are rubric-based and auditable.
	•	Behavioral models are optional, configurable, and secondary.
