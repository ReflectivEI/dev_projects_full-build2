## 📋 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT (Your Choice)

### Option A: Test Now

- Visit https://uo4alx2j8w.preview.c24.airoapp.ai
- Run the 4 tests above
- Report any issues (I'll fix immediately)

### Option B: Test Later

- Take a break (you've earned it!)
- Test when you're ready
- Everything is saved on main branch

### Option C: Provide Canonical Content

You mentioned:

> "Once all of the above is complete, I will provide (in plain text) the canonical definitions + sub-metrics + roll-up rules for all 8 Behavioral Metrics extracted from my source-of-truth document so you can paste them directly into the card content model."

**I'm ready to receive:**
- Definitions
- Sub-metrics
- Roll-up rules
- Observable indicators
- Exclusions (no intent inference)

I will update `src/lib/data.ts` with your exact content.

2. ✅ **All changes committed** (no uncommitted work)
3. ✅ **All changes pushed** (GitHub has everything)
