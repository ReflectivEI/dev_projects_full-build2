# CONSOLE ERRORS FROM SCREENSHOT

Based on the screenshot, I can see multiple errors in the browser console.

Let me check what the actual errors are by examining the roleplay page code and its dependencies.

The errors appear to be:
1. Module import failures
2. Runtime errors when loading the roleplay page
3. Missing dependencies or broken imports

Let me trace through the entire dependency chain.
